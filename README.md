# Sup? I'm Angel. 

I'm a Computer Science student since 2023, with a great interest in AI, both in its theoretical-practical aspects and in its artistic-humanistic aspects.
Currently I focus on studying theoretical AI, integrating it into practical projects, always with the aim of improving my skills to open a path towards AI Engineering.
